# Exercise-2
In this exercise, you'll practice requesting data from the Spotify API. To better understand the different possible endpoints, see [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/).

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
